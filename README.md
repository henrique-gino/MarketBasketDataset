# MarketBasketDataset

We use a public available dataset, published by dunnhumby and x university and hosted in 'link'.

In the 'data' folder we need to have three datasets to create the final market basket network dataset: 'hh_demographic', 'product', 'transaction_data'.

These are the steps executed in the 'network_dataset_creation' notebook:
1. pass
2. etc.
